## Introduction
Scratch is a simple, easy to understand programming language, that is a great tool for beginners to learn how to code. In Scratch you can create stories, animations, and games.
## Assignment
The assignment itself is quite simple, it is only necessary to copy block-for-block the code shown in the [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRBfjK-qeXE&t=1s). These notes will cover the blocks and ideas that are important in the assignment.
### Control blocks
Control blocks are an essential part of coding Scratch games.
#### Forever block

### Movement blocks
Movement blocks in both Scratch 2.0 and Scratch 3.0 are shown in dark blue. These are only applicable to sprites, and they keep track of the sprite's x and y coordinates.
### Variables
Variables are extremely important in all programming languages. In Scratch, the way to use variables is to use the blocks in the 'Variables' category. A variable in programming is similar to the idea of a variable in mathematics â€” both have a name, and are used as a subsitution for some values. However, in coding, variables arused to *store* values, instead of letting them be arbitary, as in the case of mathematics.
