## Production Function

Production is the process of turning **inputs** (factors of production, resources) into **outputs** (products, returns). We can define the **production function**:

$$
Q = P(x_1, \dots, x_n)
$$

where $x_i$ are the inputs, $P$ is the production function and $Q$ is the outputs.

### Production Period

The employment of **variable factors** increases but that of **fixed factors** remains unchanged as the output increases. In the **short run** ($SR$), there are **fixed factors** but in the **long run** ($LR$) there are only **variable factors**. In $LR$, to raise outputs, the firm adjusts all the inputs.

### Production in SR

In $SR$, for $Q = P(x_1, \dots, x_n)$, there exists some $x$ such that $x \in F$ where $F$ is the set of all *fixed factors*. Similarily we define $V$ as the set of all *variable factors*.

We define the **total product** ($TP$) as the *total output* produced by *variable factors* with given *fixed factors*:

$$
TP = Q = P(x_1, \dots, x_n)
$$

and the **average product** ($AP$):

$$
AP = \frac{TP}{\sum_{x \in V}{x}}
$$

and the **marginal product** ($MP$):

$$
MP_{x_i} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i}
$$

where $x_i \in V$.

The **law of diminishing returns** states that there exists $x_{ik} > 0$ such that:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial x_i^2} = \frac{\partial MP}{\partial x_i} > 0, x_i < x_{ik}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial MP}{\partial x_i} < 0, x_i > x_{ik}
$$

In other words, the marginal product of a variable input first increases as the the variable input increases, but there is a point where it starts to decreases. The
