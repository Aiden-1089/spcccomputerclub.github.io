# Watermelons

## Problem Description

Fergus loves eating watermelons and is a great fan of even numbers. He would like to divide each watermelon into two parts with even number weights, not obligatorily equal before eating it. Fergus is extremely tired and dying of thirst after a 6-hour competition, and that’s why you should help him find out if he can divide the melon as he wants.
Therefore, given a weight \\(w\\) of the watermelon, return `‘Y’` if it can be divided according to the rule, and `‘n’` if not.
